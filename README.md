# PHNT Typedef
It is same as the https://github.com/winsiderss/phnt PHNT Library with the only change that all the API definiations has been changed to typedef function declartions.

The name of the API has been changed all caps, so that Its easier to recognise that its a typedef declarion.

Changes has been done using a script called changer.py in the phnt folder. 

I havent tested this library so if you encounter any issues, let me know .

Made this repo becuase I need typedefs for making my shellcode loader and its always a pain to copy everything from the PHNT library.

Let me know if you encouter a issue or make a PR
